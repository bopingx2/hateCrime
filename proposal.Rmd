## Research topic

Bigotry takes many forms in the United States, but one of the most violent and dangerous forms of expression is a hate crime. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program defines a hate crime as a committed criminal offense which is motivated, in whole or in part, by the offender's bias(es).[Hate Crime FAQ] (https://s3-us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/cg-d4b776d0-d898-4153-90c8-8336f86bdfec/hate_crime_faqs.pdf) In the last three years, there has been more and more news about hate crime. This news expressed hate crimes in the United States in the news report surged to their highest level in 12 years.[CNN News] (https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/30/us/fbi-report-hate-crimes-rose-2020/index.html)As international students studying in the United States, we are curious about the historical trajectory, structure, and causes of hate crimes in the United States because this topic is very important to us (as it relates to our life safety). The primary focus of this project is to analyze the way hate crimes have manifested themselves in the United States over the past several decades, with the hope that our findings will raise awareness, not only among international students but also among the American people, of the serious issues that constitute the subject of this analysis.

## Data availability

We downloaded our Hate_Crime.csv data set from [FBI: Crime data Explore (CDE)] (https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/pages/home). Our data source is very reliable because it is the official website of the United States FBI. The CDE is an interactive tool that helps law enforcement and the public use and understands the massive amounts of crime data the FBI collects and publishes each year. The FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program manages the CDE and it manages the nation's premier crime reporting system since 1929. It generates reliable information for use by law enforcement administration, operations,  and management. Law enforcement agencies across the country voluntarily participate in the program.  The dataset collects data on various hate crimes that occurred between 1991 and 2020, and the last modified date is September 26, 2022. Quarterly releases of UCR data began in September 2020, which means that the data set we selected for this project is the latest release. The Hate Crime Statistics dataset provides annual statistics on the number of incidents, offenses, victims,  and offenders in reported crimes that are motivated in whole, or in part,  by an offender's bias against the victim's perceived race, gender, gender identity, religion, disability sexual orientation, or ethnicity. Our Data set is very large because our Information is about Hate Crime Data at the incident level. We initially poured the CSV dataset directly into R as a data frame and found that it had 220 thousand rows and 28 columns. This dataset contains a large number of null values. While I will attempt to address them in my analysis, this should still be pointed out as a potential limiting factor in relation to the quality of my analysis results. Also, most of the data in this dataset are very subjective. I cannot guarantee that the individuals working for the institutions are completely free of bias/bias, nor can I guarantee that the biases of these individuals do not affect their data collection methods in any way. We will follow the FBI's principles in this project: Since crime is a sociological phenomenon influenced by a variety of factors, the FBI discourages ranking locations or making comparisons [UCR Statistics Their Proper Use] (https://ucr.fbi.gov/ucr-statistics-their-proper-use) as a way of measuring law enforcement effectiveness. Some of this data may not be comparable to previous years because of differing levels of participation over time.[FBI: Crime data Explore (CDE)] (https://crime-data-explorer.app.cloud.gov/#)
