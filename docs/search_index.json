This series of events actually belong to the hated prime. The Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program defines a hate crime as a committed criminal offense that is motivated, in whole or in part, by the offender’s bias(es).[Hate Crime FAQ] (https://s3-us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/cg-d4b776d0-d898-4153-90c8-8336f86bdfec/hate_crime_faqs.pdf) As international students studying in the United States, we are curious about the historical trajectory, structure, and causes of hate crimes in the United States because this topic is very important to us (as it relates to our life safety). We will propose the following questions or relations to study hate prime in the United States: What are the trends of hate crimes in the last 30 years? Which groups of people were attacked the most? The relationship between the race of the attacker and the race of the attacked. Which presidential administration had the highest or lowest hate crime incidents? Which groups of people have the highest hate crime cases? What types of hate crimes (Offense Type) were most common in the last 30 years? The relationship between total hate crime and month. The relationship between hate crime cases and region. Hate crime related to states (Interactive Part D3).

The Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program defines a hate crime as a committed criminal offense which is motivated, in whole or in part, by the offender’s bias(es).[Hate Crime FAQ] (https://s3-us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/cg-d4b776d0-d898-4153-90c8-8336f86bdfec/hate_crime_faqs.pdf) In the last three years, there has been more and more news about hate crime. This news expressed hate crimes in the United States in the news report surged to their highest level in 12 years.[CNN News] (https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/30/us/fbi-report-hate-crimes-rose-2020/index.html) As international students studying in the United States, we are curious about the historical trajectory, structure, and causes of hate crimes in the United States because this topic is very important to us (as it relates to our life safety). The theme of this project is to analyze the way hate crimes have been represented in the United States over the past several decades (1991-2020). It is hoped that our findings will raise awareness not only among international students, but also among the American people, of the serious issues that constitute the subject of this analysis. 2.2 Data availability We downloaded our Hate_Crime.csv data set from [FBI: Crime data Explore (CDE)] (https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/pages/home). Our data source is very reliable because it is released by the FBI. The CDE is an interactive tool that helps law enforcement and the public uses and understands the massive amounts of crime data the FBI collects and publishes each year. The FBI’s UCR Program manages the CDE and the nation’s premier crime reporting system since 1929. It generates reliable information for use by law enforcement administration, operations, and management. Law enforcement agencies across the country voluntarily participate in the program. The data set collects data on various hate crimes that occurred between 1991 and 2020, and the last update date is September 26, 2022. Law enforcement agencies report hate crimes brought to their attention monthly or quarterly to the FBI either through their state UCR programs or directly, which means that the data set we selected for this project is the latest release. The Hate Crime Statistics data set provides annual statistics on the number of incidents, offenses, victims, and offenders in reported crimes that are motivated in whole, or in part, by an offender’s bias against the victim’s perceived social identity. Our data set is significantly large because our information is about hate crime data at the incident level. We initially poured the CSV data set directly into R as a data frame and found that it had 220k rows and 28 columns. This data is considered “large data” because each row is a point in time for each event, so there are multiple rows per year, each with its own event. Each event has a unique id, and an exact date (year, month, day), and other characteristics columns. Most of the data in this data set can be classified as qualitative because most of the data in this data set are categorical data about event characteristics (name, date, location, bias, agency) rather than quantitative data (numbers, etc.) This data set contains a large number of null values. While we will attempt to address them in our analysis, this should still be pointed out as a potential limiting factor in relation to the quality of our analysis results. Also, most of the data in this data set are very subjective. We cannot guarantee that the individuals working for the institutions are completely free of bias, nor can we guarantee that the biases of these individuals do not affect their data collection methods in any way. However, the UCR explained that because of motivation is subjective, it is sometimes difficult to know with certainty whether a crime resulted from the offender’s bias. Offender’s bias is not a sufficient condition to a hate crime, and an incident was reported as a hate crime only when law enforcement confirms that there are sufficient evidences support that the crime was conducted by offender’s prejudice. [FBI: Crime data Explore (CDE)] (https://crime-data-explorer.app.cloud.gov/#) The nice thing about this data set is that if we have questions about the data set, we can contact the UCR program directly to get answers. We will follow the FBI’s principles in this project: Since crime is a sociological phenomenon influenced by a variety of factors, the FBI discourages ranking locations or making comparisons [UCR Statistics Their Proper Use] (https://ucr.fbi.gov/ucr-statistics-their-proper-use) as a way of measuring law enforcement effectiveness. Some of this data may not be comparable to previous years because of differing levels of participation over time.[FBI: Crime data Explore (CDE)] (https://crime-data-explorer.app.cloud.gov/#) "],["data.html", "Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.3 Missing value analysis", " Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources Our original data file Hate_Crime.csv is from FBI Crime data Explorer (CDE) (https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/pages/home). According to the description provided along with the file, the data was collected through FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program. UCR is a program aimed to provide reliable crime statistics for public use. There are approximately 18,000 law enforcement units in the US participate in this program. Each unit voluntarily send their data through National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS), which allows them provide detailed information of a crime such as offenders’ bias against specific social identity. At the end of each year, FBI will release the data a year before with multiple section through CDE and Hate Crime Statistics is a dedicated collection along with others. ## The dimension of the dataset is 219577 rows and 28 columns. ## The columns&#39; names are: ## [1] &quot;INCIDENT_ID&quot; &quot;DATA_YEAR&quot; &quot;ORI&quot; ## [4] &quot;PUB_AGENCY_NAME&quot; &quot;PUB_AGENCY_UNIT&quot; &quot;AGENCY_TYPE_NAME&quot; ## [7] &quot;STATE_ABBR&quot; &quot;STATE_NAME&quot; &quot;DIVISION_NAME&quot; ## [10] &quot;REGION_NAME&quot; &quot;POPULATION_GROUP_CODE&quot; &quot;POPULATION_GROUP_DESC&quot; ## [13] &quot;INCIDENT_DATE&quot; &quot;ADULT_VICTIM_COUNT&quot; &quot;JUVENILE_VICTIM_COUNT&quot; ## [16] &quot;TOTAL_OFFENDER_COUNT&quot; &quot;ADULT_OFFENDER_COUNT&quot; &quot;JUVENILE_OFFENDER_COUNT&quot; ## [19] &quot;OFFENDER_RACE&quot; &quot;OFFENDER_ETHNICITY&quot; &quot;VICTIM_COUNT&quot; ## [22] &quot;OFFENSE_NAME&quot; &quot;TOTAL_INDIVIDUAL_VICTIMS&quot; &quot;LOCATION_NAME&quot; ## [25] &quot;BIAS_DESC&quot; &quot;VICTIM_TYPES&quot; &quot;MULTIPLE_OFFENSE&quot; ## [28] &quot;MULTIPLE_BIAS&quot; As we discover, the data has 219577 rows and 28 columns. Most of the variables are categorical. INCIDENT_ID, ADULT_VICTIM_COUNT, JUVENILE_VICTIM_COUNT, TOTAL_OFFENDER_COUNT, ADULT_OFFENDER_COUNT, JUVENILE_OFFENDER_COUNT, VICTIM_COUNT, and TOTAL_INDIVIDUAL_VICTIMS are continuous variables. DATA_YEAR and INCIDENT_DATE should be date variables, but they are stored in int and chr. Although FBI provided a very large and detailed dataset, it contains several issues. The most important one, as stated by FBI, because the motivation of a crime is a subjective factor, it is difficult to determine whether the crime is because of offenders’ bias. Hence, law enforcement conclude a hate crime only if there are sufficient evidence to prove it. This resulting in underestimating overall occurrence of hate crimes but it could guarantee the accuracy of our analysis. As we understanding and interpreting dataset, we found some problem regarding the quality of the dataset. There are multiple columns contains value of empty string instead of NA, which leads to a erroneous missing value analysis. In the OFFENSE_NAME and BIAS_DESC column, some observation contains multiple variables. These situations are indicated in MULTIPLE_OFFENSE and MULTIPLE_BIAS. It is reasonable for a crime aiming to multiple group of people with several offense, but it creates obstacles when analyzing offense type and bias. There are other problems, like TOTAL_OFFENDER_COUNT contains a huge portion of 0s and adults and juveniles partition are not reported before 2011. Since we dropped these columns, we do not dig into the reason of these problems. 3.2 Cleaning / transformation First cleaning step is to extract columns needed for out target. We have already mentioned our goal in the introduction section, here we just select related column and reduced it to 7 columns. ## The dimension of the dataset is 219577 rows and 7 columns. ## The columns&#39; names are: ## [1] &quot;INCIDENT_ID&quot; &quot;STATE_NAME&quot; &quot;REGION_NAME&quot; &quot;INCIDENT_DATE&quot; &quot;OFFENDER_RACE&quot; &quot;OFFENSE_NAME&quot; ## [7] &quot;BIAS_DESC&quot; Next we will split the row with multiple BIAS_DESC and OFFENSE_NAME. Before the split, the unique entries in BIAS_DESC and OFFENSE_NAME are 279 and 353. After the split, the unique entries in BIAS_DESC and OFFENSE_NAME are reduced to 35 and 48. Note that this will create multiple rows for one crime and can leads to over counting. We will only count crime with distinct INCIDENT_ID to overcome this issue. ## BEFORE ## The unique BIAS_DESC counts is: 279. ## The unique OFFENSE_NAME counts is: 353. ## AFTER ## The unique BIAS_DESC counts is: 35. ## The unique OFFENSE_NAME counts is: 48. ## The dimension of the dataset is 228912 rows and 7 columns. A strange pattern in BIAS_DESC is that while it contains Anti-Lesbian (Female), Anti-Gay (Male), Anti-Bisexual, and Anti-Transgender separately, it also has a entry Anti-Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, or Transgender (Mixed Group). We will combine the separate listings into the mixed one. ## The unique BIAS_DESC counts is: 31. The INCIDENT_DATE is stored as character class. We need to change it into Date class. ## BEFORE ## The class of INCIDENT_DATE is : character. ## AFTER ## The class of INCIDENT_DATE is : Date. Last step is to process empty string. We consider it as NA. And because empty string only happens in categorical variables, we will replace it with Unknown. ## BEFORE ## The number of rows with empty string is : 20. ## AFTER ## The number of rows with empty string is : 0. 3.3 Missing value analysis "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Trends of hate crime 4.2 Which groups of people were attacked the most? 4.3 The relationship between the race of the attacker and the race of the attacked. 4.4 Which presidential administration had the highest or lowest hate crime rate? 4.5 Which groups of people have the highest hate crime cases? 4.6 What types of hate crimes (Offense Type) were most common in the last 30 years? 4.7 The relationship between total hate crime and month. 4.8 The relationship between hate crime cases and region.", " Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Trends of hate crime The following shows the trend chart of the total number of reported hate crime cases with each year. As can be seen from the figure, hate crime case increased most sharply in 1991-1992, 1994-1995, 2000-2001 and 2019-2020. Conversely, from 1993-1994, 2001-2002, 2008-2009, 2012-2013, the decline was the most dramatic. From 2001 to 2014, the total number of hate crime cases showed a general trend of decline. However, from 2014 to 2020, the total number of hate crime cases in the United States increased dramatically. In the whole chart, 1991 had the lowest total number of hate crime cases. 2020 has the highest total number of hate crime cases. We know that the year has something to do with how long a U.S. president has been in office, Based on this picture, we will answer the question of which presidential administration had the highest or lowest hate crime incidents in the third subsection. 4.2 Which groups of people were attacked the most? The plot shows the number of total hate crimes for each prejudice. As can be seen from the Cleveland dot chart, black or African Americans are the groups most attacked by hate crime(almost 70,000 reported incidents). Asians, however, were the seventh most attacked group(over 7,000 reported incidents). Please note that our graph here only shows the total number of incidents involving people who have been attacked over the last 20 years, as opposed to which group is most vulnerable. We will take the results of the graph to analyse the relationship between the total number of people attacked in different categories under different presidents. 4.3 The relationship between the race of the attacker and the race of the attacked. The following graph shows the relationship between the race of the attacker and the race of the attacked. Note we will ignore the unknown offender race in this case. We found that when Black or African american people were attacked, white people attacked them the most, by a significant margin. We also found that whites were the most aggressive toward all groups except toward Jewish. The majority of Anti-White hate crimes were committed by Black people and White people. 4.4 Which presidential administration had the highest or lowest hate crime rate? Because each U.S. president has a different number of years in office, it would be unfair to compare total hate crime cases here. So we divided the number of hate crime cases during each president’s tenure by the number of years in office to get the hate crime rate for each president. We found that Donald Trump had the highest hate prime rate and George Bush(1st term) had the lowest. But the difference between the three presidents with the highest rates is not obvious. At the same time, we can also draw a trend chart of the changing relationship of prejudice over time during the tenure of different presidents. We found an increase in all kinds of prejudice during the first George Bush administration. During the period of Bill Clinton, the general trend of anti Black or African american was up, while the general trend of anti White was down. All kinds of prejudice in the second George Bush years were in a lull (neither rising nor falling). The overall trend of anti-Black or African american decline under Barack Obama administration is different from any other period. While anti-Black or African american trends have risen sharply under Donald Trump years, other kinds of prejudice have crept up. 4.5 Which groups of people have the highest hate crime cases? Note here we ignore the unknown case since it tells nothing. Through this pie chart, we can find that 70.7 percent of all reported hate crime cases were committed by White people, which is nearly 45% higher than the black or African American group that ranks second. We can find that Asians are less likely to be offenders. 4.6 What types of hate crimes (Offense Type) were most common in the last 30 years? This image shows all types of offense type. We found that “Destruction/Damage/Vandalism of Property”, “Intimidation”, “Simple Assault” , “Aggravated Assault” are the most popular. And the total number of incidents is far ahead of the latter category. We will use these four key offense type to draw the relationship between Offense type and Prejudice. We took the top four offense types in the figure above and the top seven prejudice types together to draw this grouped bar chart. This chart shows the total amount of hate crimes that were motivated by each type of prejudice for each type of hate crime. The majority of each type of hate crime is motivated by an Anti-Black or African American prejudice, with “Intimidation” and “Destruction/Damage/Vandalism of Property” being the most common type of hate crimes motivated by this prejudice. “Anti-Black or African American” prejudice has the highest percentage in every offense type. We found that the percentage of Anti-Jewish prejudice in the “Destruction/Damage/Vandalism of Property” offense type is particularly high. The LGBT community also makes up a significant portion of every offense type. This mosaic graph shows the relationship between Offender Race and Offense Type. Note this results ignore the unknown Unknown Offender Race. We found that Whites made up the largest portion of the top 4 offense types, followed by Blacks or African Americans. 4.7 The relationship between total hate crime and month. By observing the bar chart below, we can find that September and October are the periods of high incidence of hate crimes, while December is the period of low incidence of hate crimes 4.8 The relationship between hate crime cases and region. We found that the West region has the highest number of reported Hate Crime cases, and U.S. Territories has the least number. Here U.S. Territories stands for Guam which makes sense since it has small number of population. The Midwest has the lowest number of hate crimes in the continental United States.
