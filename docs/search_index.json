This series of events actually belong to the hated prime. The Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program defines a hate crime as a committed criminal offense that is motivated, in whole or in part, by the offender’s bias(es).[Hate Crime FAQ] (https://s3-us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/cg-d4b776d0-d898-4153-90c8-8336f86bdfec/hate_crime_faqs.pdf) As international students studying in the United States, we are curious about the historical trajectory, structure, and causes of hate crimes in the United States because this topic is very important to us (as it relates to our life safety). We will propose the following questions or relations to study hate prime in the United States: What are the trends of hate crimes in the last 30 years? Which presidential administration had the highest or lowest hate crime incidents? What types of hate crimes (Offense Type) were most common in the last 30 years? Which groups of people are more vulnerable to attack? Which groups of people are more likely to hate crime? The relationship between the race of the attacker and the race of the attacked. The relationship between total hate crime and month. The relationship between hate crime cases and region. Hate crime related to states (Interactive Part D3).

The Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program defines a hate crime as a committed criminal offense which is motivated, in whole or in part, by the offender’s bias(es).[Hate Crime FAQ] (https://s3-us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/cg-d4b776d0-d898-4153-90c8-8336f86bdfec/hate_crime_faqs.pdf) In the last three years, there has been more and more news about hate crime. This news expressed hate crimes in the United States in the news report surged to their highest level in 12 years.[CNN News] (https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/30/us/fbi-report-hate-crimes-rose-2020/index.html) As international students studying in the United States, we are curious about the historical trajectory, structure, and causes of hate crimes in the United States because this topic is very important to us (as it relates to our life safety). The theme of this project is to analyze the way hate crimes have been represented in the United States over the past several decades (1991-2020). It is hoped that our findings will raise awareness not only among international students, but also among the American people, of the serious issues that constitute the subject of this analysis. 2.2 Data availability We downloaded our Hate_Crime.csv data set from [FBI: Crime data Explore (CDE)] (https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/pages/home). Our data source is very reliable because it is released by the FBI. The CDE is an interactive tool that helps law enforcement and the public uses and understands the massive amounts of crime data the FBI collects and publishes each year. The FBI’s UCR Program manages the CDE and the nation’s premier crime reporting system since 1929. It generates reliable information for use by law enforcement administration, operations, and management. Law enforcement agencies across the country voluntarily participate in the program. The data set collects data on various hate crimes that occurred between 1991 and 2020, and the last update date is September 26, 2022. Law enforcement agencies report hate crimes brought to their attention monthly or quarterly to the FBI either through their state UCR programs or directly, which means that the data set we selected for this project is the latest release. The Hate Crime Statistics data set provides annual statistics on the number of incidents, offenses, victims, and offenders in reported crimes that are motivated in whole, or in part, by an offender’s bias against the victim’s perceived social identity. Our data set is significantly large because our information is about hate crime data at the incident level. We initially poured the CSV data set directly into R as a data frame and found that it had 220k rows and 28 columns. This data is considered “large data” because each row is a point in time for each event, so there are multiple rows per year, each with its own event. Each event has a unique id, and an exact date (year, month, day), and other characteristics columns. Most of the data in this data set can be classified as qualitative because most of the data in this data set are categorical data about event characteristics (name, date, location, bias, agency) rather than quantitative data (numbers, etc.) This data set contains a large number of null values. While we will attempt to address them in our analysis, this should still be pointed out as a potential limiting factor in relation to the quality of our analysis results. Also, most of the data in this data set are very subjective. We cannot guarantee that the individuals working for the institutions are completely free of bias, nor can we guarantee that the biases of these individuals do not affect their data collection methods in any way. However, the UCR explained that because of motivation is subjective, it is sometimes difficult to know with certainty whether a crime resulted from the offender’s bias. Offender’s bias is not a sufficient condition to a hate crime, and an incident was reported as a hate crime only when law enforcement confirms that there are sufficient evidences support that the crime was conducted by offender’s prejudice. [FBI: Crime data Explore (CDE)] (https://crime-data-explorer.app.cloud.gov/#) The nice thing about this data set is that if we have questions about the data set, we can contact the UCR program directly to get answers. We will follow the FBI’s principles in this project: Since crime is a sociological phenomenon influenced by a variety of factors, the FBI discourages ranking locations or making comparisons [UCR Statistics Their Proper Use] (https://ucr.fbi.gov/ucr-statistics-their-proper-use) as a way of measuring law enforcement effectiveness.

As can be seen from the figure, hate crime case increased most sharply in 1991-1992, 1994-1995, 2000-2001 and 2019-2020. Conversely, from 1993-1994, 2001-2002, 2008-2009, 2012-2013, the decline was the most dramatic. From 2001 to 2014, the total number of hate crime cases showed a general trend of decline. However, from 2014 to 2020, the total number of hate crime cases in the United States increased dramatically. In the whole chart, 1991 had the lowest total number of hate crime cases. 2020 has the highest total number of hate crime cases. We know that the year has something to do with how long a U.S. president has been in office, Based on this picture, we will answer the question of which presidential administration had the highest or lowest hate crime incidents in the next subsection. 4.2 Which groups of people are more vulnerable to attack? 4.3 Which presidential administration had the highest or lowest hate crime rate? Because each U.S. president has a different number of years in office, it would be unfair to compare total hate crime cases here. So we divided the number of hate crime cases during each president’s tenure by the number of years in office to get the hate crime rate for each president. We found that Donald Trum had the highest hate prime rate and George Bush(1st term) had the lowest. But the difference between the three presidents with the highest rates is not obvious. At the same time, we can also draw a trend chart of the changing relationship of prejudice over time during the tenure of different presidents.
