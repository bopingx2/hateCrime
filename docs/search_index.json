We will propose the following questions or relations to study hate prime in the United States: What are the trends of hate crimes in the last 30 years? Which groups of people were attacked the most? The relationship between the attacker’s and the victim’s race. Which presidential administration had the highest or lowest hate crime incidents? Which groups of people have the highest hate crime cases? What types of hate crimes (Offense Type) were most common in the last 30 years? The relationship between total hate crime and month. The relationship between hate crime cases and region. Hate crime related to states.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program defines a hate crime as a committed criminal offense which is motivated, in whole or in part, by the offender’s bias(es).[Hate Crime FAQ] (https://s3-us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/cg-d4b776d0-d898-4153-90c8-8336f86bdfec/hate_crime_faqs.pdf) In the last three years, there has been more and more news about hate crime. This news expressed hate crimes in the United States in the news report surged to their highest level in 12 years.[CNN News] (https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/30/us/fbi-report-hate-crimes-rose-2020/index.html) As international students studying in the United States, we are curious about the historical trajectory, structure, and causes of hate crimes in the United States because this topic is very important to us (as it relates to our life safety). The theme of this project is to analyze the way hate crimes have been represented in the United States over the past several decades (1991-2020). It is hoped that our findings will raise awareness not only among international students, but also among the American people, of the serious issues that constitute the subject of this analysis. 2.2 Data availability We downloaded our Hate_Crime.csv data set from [FBI: Crime data Explore (CDE)] (https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/pages/home). Our data source is very reliable because it is released by the FBI. The CDE is an interactive tool that helps law enforcement and the public uses and understands the massive amounts of crime data the FBI collects and publishes each year. The FBI’s UCR Program manages the CDE and the nation’s premier crime reporting system since 1929. It generates reliable information for use by law enforcement administration, operations, and management. Law enforcement agencies across the country voluntarily participate in the program. The data set collects data on various hate crimes that occurred between 1991 and 2020, and the last update date is September 26, 2022. Law enforcement agencies report hate crimes brought to their attention monthly or quarterly to the FBI either through their state UCR programs or directly, which means that the data set we selected for this project is the latest release. The Hate Crime Statistics data set provides annual statistics on the number of incidents, offenses, victims, and offenders in reported crimes that are motivated in whole, or in part, by an offender’s bias against the victim’s perceived social identity. Our data set is significantly large because our information is about hate crime data at the incident level. We initially poured the CSV data set directly into R as a data frame and found that it had 220k rows and 28 columns. This data is considered “large data” because each row is a point in time for each event, so there are multiple rows per year, each with its own event. Each event has a unique id, and an exact date (year, month, day), and other characteristics columns. Most of the data in this data set can be classified as qualitative because most of the data in this data set are categorical data about event characteristics (name, date, location, bias, agency) rather than quantitative data (numbers, etc.) This data set contains a large number of null values. While we will attempt to address them in our analysis, this should still be pointed out as a potential limiting factor in relation to the quality of our analysis results. Also, most of the data in this data set are very subjective. We cannot guarantee that the individuals working for the institutions are completely free of bias, nor can we guarantee that the biases of these individuals do not affect their data collection methods in any way. However, the UCR explained that because of motivation is subjective, it is sometimes difficult to know with certainty whether a crime resulted from the offender’s bias. Offender’s bias is not a sufficient condition to a hate crime, and an incident was reported as a hate crime only when law enforcement confirms that there are sufficient evidences support that the crime was conducted by offender’s prejudice. [FBI: Crime data Explore (CDE)] (https://crime-data-explorer.app.cloud.gov/#) The nice thing about this data set is that if we have questions about the data set, we can contact the UCR program directly to get answers. We will follow the FBI’s principles in this project: Since crime is a sociological phenomenon influenced by a variety of factors, the FBI discourages ranking locations or making comparisons [UCR Statistics Their Proper Use] (https://ucr.fbi.gov/ucr-statistics-their-proper-use) as a way of measuring law enforcement effectiveness. Some of this data may not be comparable to previous years because of differing levels of participation over time.[FBI: Crime data Explore (CDE)] (https://crime-data-explorer.app.cloud.gov/#) "],["data.html", "Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.3 Missing value analysis", " Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources Our original data file, Hate_Crime.csv, is from the FBI’s Crime Data Explorer (CDE) (https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/pages/home). According to the description by the FBI, the data was collected through the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program. UCR is a program aimed at providing reliable crime statistics for public use. Approximately 18,000 law enforcement units in the US participate in this program. Each unit voluntarily sends its data through the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS), which allows them to provide detailed information about a crime, such as offenders’ bias against specific social identity. At the end of each year, the FBI will release the data a year before with multiple sections through CDE, and Hate Crime Statistics is a dedicated collection along with others. ## The dimension of the dataset is 219577 rows and 28 columns. ## The columns&#39; names are: ## [1] &quot;INCIDENT_ID&quot; ## [2] &quot;DATA_YEAR&quot; ## [3] &quot;ORI&quot; ## [4] &quot;PUB_AGENCY_NAME&quot; ## [5] &quot;PUB_AGENCY_UNIT&quot; ## [6] &quot;AGENCY_TYPE_NAME&quot; ## [7] &quot;STATE_ABBR&quot; ## [8] &quot;STATE_NAME&quot; ## [9] &quot;DIVISION_NAME&quot; ## [10] &quot;REGION_NAME&quot; ## [11] &quot;POPULATION_GROUP_CODE&quot; ## [12] &quot;POPULATION_GROUP_DESC&quot; ## [13] &quot;INCIDENT_DATE&quot; ## [14] &quot;ADULT_VICTIM_COUNT&quot; ## [15] &quot;JUVENILE_VICTIM_COUNT&quot; ## [16] &quot;TOTAL_OFFENDER_COUNT&quot; ## [17] &quot;ADULT_OFFENDER_COUNT&quot; ## [18] &quot;JUVENILE_OFFENDER_COUNT&quot; ## [19] &quot;OFFENDER_RACE&quot; ## [20] &quot;OFFENDER_ETHNICITY&quot; ## [21] &quot;VICTIM_COUNT&quot; ## [22] &quot;OFFENSE_NAME&quot; ## [23] &quot;TOTAL_INDIVIDUAL_VICTIMS&quot; ## [24] &quot;LOCATION_NAME&quot; ## [25] &quot;BIAS_DESC&quot; ## [26] &quot;VICTIM_TYPES&quot; ## [27] &quot;MULTIPLE_OFFENSE&quot; ## [28] &quot;MULTIPLE_BIAS&quot; As we discover, the data has 219577 rows and 28 columns. Most of the variables are categorical. INCIDENT_ID, ADULT_VICTIM_COUNT, JUVENILE_VICTIM_COUNT, TOTAL_OFFENDER_COUNT, ADULT_OFFENDER_COUNT, JUVENILE_OFFENDER_COUNT, VICTIM_COUNT, and TOTAL_INDIVIDUAL_VICTIMS are continuous variables. DATA_YEAR and INCIDENT_DATE should be date variables, but they are stored in int and chr. Although the FBI provided an extensive and detailed dataset, it contains several issues. The most important one, as stated by the FBI, is that because a crime’s motivation is subjective, it is difficult to determine whether the crime is because of the offenders’ bias. Hence, law enforcement concludes a hate crime only if sufficient evidence proves it is a hate crime. This results in underestimating the overall occurrence of hate crimes, but it could guarantee the accuracy of our analysis. As we understood and interpreted the dataset, we found some problems regarding the quality of the dataset. Multiple columns contain value of empty string instead of NA, which leads to erroneous missing value analysis. Some observation contains multiple variables in the OFFENSE_NAME and BIAS_DESC columns. These situations are indicated in MULTIPLE_OFFENSE and MULTIPLE_BIAS. It is reasonable for a crime aimed at multiple groups of people with several offenses, but it creates obstacles when analyzing offense type and bias. Other problems, like TOTAL_OFFENDER_COUNT contains a massive portion of 0s, and adults and juveniles partition is not reported before 2013. Since we dropped these columns, we did not dig into the reason for these problems. 3.2 Cleaning / transformation The first cleaning step is to extract the columns needed for our target. We have already mentioned our goal in the introduction section. Here we selected related columns and reduced it to 7 columns. ## The dimension of the dataset is 219577 rows and 7 columns. ## The columns&#39; names are: ## [1] &quot;INCIDENT_ID&quot; &quot;STATE_NAME&quot; &quot;REGION_NAME&quot; ## [4] &quot;INCIDENT_DATE&quot; &quot;OFFENDER_RACE&quot; &quot;OFFENSE_NAME&quot; ## [7] &quot;BIAS_DESC&quot; Next, we will split the row with multiple BIAS_DESC and OFFENSE_NAME. Before the split, the unique entries in BIAS_DESC and OFFENSE_NAME are 279 and 353. After the split, the unique entries in BIAS_DESC and OFFENSE_NAME are reduced to 35 and 48. Note that this will create multiple rows for one crime and can lead to overcounting. Therefore, we will only count crimes with distinct INCIDENT_ID to overcome this issue. ## BEFORE ## The unique BIAS_DESC counts is: 279. ## The unique OFFENSE_NAME counts is: 353. ## AFTER ## The unique BIAS_DESC counts is: 35. ## The unique OFFENSE_NAME counts is: 48. ## The dimension of the dataset is 228912 rows and 7 columns. A strange pattern in BIAS_DESC is that while it contains Anti-Lesbian (Female), Anti-Gay (Male), Anti-Bisexual, and Anti-Transgender separately, it also has an entry Anti-Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, or Transgender (Mixed Group). We will combine the separate listings into the mixed one. ## The unique BIAS_DESC counts is: 31. The INCIDENT_DATE is stored as character class. We need to change it into Date class. ## BEFORE ## The class of INCIDENT_DATE is : character. ## AFTER ## The class of INCIDENT_DATE is : Date. The last step is to process empty strings. We consider it as NA. And because empty string only happens in categorical variables, we will replace it with Unknown. ## BEFORE ## The number of rows with empty string is : 20. ## AFTER ## The number of rows with empty string is : 0. 3.3 Missing value analysis Since our data set is gigantic, we cannot use either a heat map or mi library to plot and interpret the missing pattern. Here we will use redav library provided by Professor Robbins to plot the missing patterns. We changed the column names into their index to better visualize the graph. We also transform all empty strings into NA. For the raw dataset, the missing pattern seems messy. However, it shows that about 95% of rows are missing PUB_AGENCY_UNIT, 80% of rows are missing OFFENDER_ETHNICITY, and 75% are missing ADULT_VICTIM_COUNT, JUVENILE_VICTIM_COUNT, ADULT_OFFENDER_COUNT, and JUVENILE_OFFENDER_COUNT. It is not surprising that PUB_AGENCY_UNIT has a considerable number of missing because after we dig into the dataset, PUB_AGENCY_UNIT are only provided when the unit is affiliated with home law enforcement, like university or state police. Aside from that, the other five columns are usually missing together. While checking the dataset, we found that all the rows are missing these five values until 2013. After 2013, some of them are still missing but gradually decreased. A possible explanation is that before 2013, the FBI did not require law enforcement to report this data. After 2013, the FBI required law enforcement to provide this information, and some of them responded to it immediately, while others may have had some difficulties in submitting this data. Still, eventually, they all comply with the FBI requirement. In addition to these major columns missing, TOTAL_INDIVIDUAL_VICTIMS and OFFENDER_RACE also have some minor missing, but they don’t have correlation, which seems to be happened completely at random. The cleaned data only has one missing pattern and a negligible amount of missing. The missing column is OFFENDER_RACE and in the cleaning part, we have already counted there only 20 missing values. We found that OFFENDER_RACE has an entry Unknown. Therefore, we will replace NA with Unknown. "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Trends of hate crime: Overall rise, but there were also periods of Depression 4.2 Black or African American people were the most discriminated against 4.3 Whites discriminated against other races the most, while Blacks preferred to discriminate against Whites 4.4 The frequency of Hate Crimes is the highest under Donald Trump, but it is not obvious 4.5 White people have the most recorded Hate Crimes 4.6 Top Offense Types of Hate Crimes 4.7 The total number of Hate Crimes at the end or beginning of the year is relatively small 4.8 The West and Northeast regions have the highest Hate Crime records", " Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Trends of hate crime: Overall rise, but there were also periods of Depression The following shows the trend chart of yearly reported hate crime cases reported. As can be seen from the figure, hate crime cases increased most sharply in 1991-1992, 1994-1995, 2000-2001, and 2019-2020. Conversely, the decline was the most dramatic from 1993-1994, 2001-2002, 2008-2009, and 2012-2013. From 2001 to 2014, the total number of hate crime cases showed a general trend of decline. However, from 2014 to 2020, the total number of hate crime cases in the United States increased dramatically. In the whole chart, 1991 had the lowest number of hate crime cases. On the other hand, 2020 has the highest total number of hate crime cases. We know the year has something to do with how long a U.S. president has been in office. Based on this picture, we will answer the question of which presidential administration had the highest or lowest hate crime incidents in the third subsection. 4.2 Black or African American people were the most discriminated against The plot shows the number of total hate crimes for each prejudice. As can be seen from the Cleveland dot chart, Black or African Americans are the groups most attacked by hate crime(almost 70,000 reported incidents). Asians, however, were the seventh most attacked group(over 7,000 reported incidents). Please note that our graph here only shows the total number of incidents involving people who have been attacked over the last 20 years, as opposed to the most vulnerable group. We will take the graph results to analyze the relationship between the total number of people attacked in different categories under different presidents. 4.3 Whites discriminated against other races the most, while Blacks preferred to discriminate against Whites The following graph shows the relationship between the attacker’s and the victim’s race. Note we will ignore the Unknown offender race in this case. We found that when Black or African American people were attacked, White people attacked them the most, by a significant margin. We also found that White people were the most aggressive toward all groups except toward Jewish. Most Anti-White hate crimes were committed by Black and White people. 4.4 The frequency of Hate Crimes is the highest under Donald Trump, but it is not obvious Because each U.S. president has a different number of years in office, comparing total hate crime cases here would be unfair. So we divided the number of hate crime cases during each president’s tenure by the number of years in office to get the hate crime rate for each president. We found that Donald Trump had the highest hate crime rate and George H. W. Bush had the lowest. But the difference between the three presidents with the highest rates is not obvious. At the same time, we can also draw a trend chart of the changing relationship of prejudice overtime during the tenure of different presidents. We found an increase in all kinds of prejudice during the George H. W. Bush administration. During the Bill Clinton period, the general trend of Anti Black or African American was up, while the general trend of Anti White was down. All kinds of prejudice in the George W. Bush years were in a lull (neither rising nor falling). The overall trend of Anti-Black or African American decline under the Barack Obama administration differs from any other period. While Anti-Black or African American trends have risen sharply under Donald Trump years, different kinds of prejudice have crept up. 4.5 White people have the most recorded Hate Crimes Note here we ignore the unknown case since it tells nothing. Through this bar chart, we can find that most of the reported hate crime cases were committed by White people, which is a lot higher than the Black or African American group that ranks second. We can find that Asians are less likely to be offenders. 4.6 Top Offense Types of Hate Crimes This image shows all types of offense types. We found that Destruction/Damage/Vandalism of Property, Intimidation, Simple Assault , and Aggravated Assault are the most popular. And the total number of incidents is far ahead of the latter category. Therefore, we will use these four key offense types to draw the relationship between Offense type and Prejudice. We took the top four offense types in the figure above and the top seven prejudice types of drawing this grouped bar chart. This chart shows the total number of hate crimes motivated by each kind of prejudice for each type of hate crime. The majority of each type of hate crime is motivated by an Anti-Black or African American prejudice, with Intimidation and Destruction/Damage/Vandalism of Property being the most common type of hate crimes motivated by this prejudice. Anti-Black or African American prejudice has the highest percentage in every offense type. In addition, we found that the percentage of Anti-Jewish prejudice in the Destruction/Damage/Vandalism of Property offense type is particularly high. The LGBT community also makes up a significant portion of every offense type. This mosaic graph shows the relationship between Offender Race and Offense Type. Note these results ignore the Unknown Offender Race. We found that Whites made up the most significant portion of the top 4 offense types, followed by Blacks or African Americans. 4.7 The total number of Hate Crimes at the end or beginning of the year is relatively small By observing the bar chart below, we can find that September and October are the periods of high incidence of hate crimes, while December is the period of low incidence of hate crimes 4.8 The West and Northeast regions have the highest Hate Crime records We found that the West region has the highest reported Hate Crime cases, and U.S. Territories has the least number. Here U.S. Territories stands for Guam, which makes sense since it has a small population. The Midwest has the lowest number of hate crimes in the continental United States. The Other entry refers to incidents reported by law enforcement at the feral level, such as the FBI and military police. Due to their distinctness, we did not dig into them. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 5 Interactive component", " Chapter 5 Interactive component We use an interactive map to illustrate each state’s hate crime trend from 1991 to 2020. There is a slider at the bottom of the map which can slide to choose the year user want to see. A play button next to the slider can animate the trend from the current year to 2020. A stop button is next to the play button, which can stop the animation if the user wants to dig into the current year’s data. A pop-up will show the state name and hate crime count for that year by putting the cursor on a state. In the interactive map, we could discover that most of the hate crimes happened in California, New York, and New Jersey. Other states have relatively fewer cases and stable trends. But in 2020, almost all states had more hate crimes than in 2019. California has a unique pattern. Its yearly count quickly increased from 1991 to 2001, then went downward until 2014, and started to grow again. New York has an overall decreasing trend, while New Jersey has a generally increasing trend. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 6 Conclusion", " Chapter 6 Conclusion In this introduction, we ask nine questions, and answers are also provided in diagram form in each subsection: These charts show the structure and history of hate crimes in the United States over nearly 30 years. In this project, we only use exploratory techniques to recognize our data. However, our project still has some limitations. The limitations are reflected in that our data covers only the 30 years from 1991 to 2020, missing the first two years of George W. Bush’s first term. The absence of this data is likely to impact the question of which presidents have the highest average rate of hate crimes. Meanwhile, this data also lacks the portion after 2020. If time permits, we will continue to look for these data to have a more comprehensive and detailed understanding of the overall cognition of hate crimes in the United States. Another limitation is that when we’re looking at hate crimes, other than the average annual rate of the president, we’re looking at the total number of hate crimes. This is a slight loss of scientific rigor. We would have had a population range for each city in our data, but these data contain a lot of NA, and the population range in the data is a pretty extensive range, which makes it very difficult for us to calculate the rate of hate crimes among the population. So if time permits, we can find the number of people in the city each year and calculate the hate crime rate. 90% of our project’s work is on categorical variables analysis. As this course focuses on exploration, we have yet to build a model to predict the hate crime rate. Because of the data we have, we do very little quantitative analysis. Instead, we do more qualitative analysis. And as data scientists, we should use data to improve our social environment. However, due to the limitations of our project, we cannot give a series of suggestions on how to reduce the number of hate crimes and thus make our society safer. What we can do is use graphs to tell you what a hate crime is, what its manifestations are, what its composition is, and what its history is. I hope our analysis generalized this knowledge. If we have time to continue to improve our project after the end of the course, we will find other data on the urban population each year. It is better to find new data on hate crimes in the last two years to calculate each place’s hate crime rate and build a model to predict the hate crime rate of a specific city in a particular state in the future. This kind of analysis can give us a preventive effect. "]]
